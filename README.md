# TheNetworkGame
The network game I came up with to teach some people I know about networking and some priciples of security.

Server Instructions
------
Clone the git repo, then run the levels via the .sh files. For example:
    ./level_1.sh
will start level 1.

Client Instructions
------
Either find a server ip and port that is hosting The Network Game, or download your own.
It is recommended that you use netcat for playing. For example:
    netcat \<host\> \<port\>
